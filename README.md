# ZICK-ZACK
A mini game i build using android studio and surface-view(android component that allow you to draw on screen) all the calculation and movement 
were done on threads so the main ui runs smoothly 

Each time you tap the screen the character change his direction and the goal is to avoid the incomming walls!
